strings. Provide translations and seamlessly retrieve them at runtime.

## Introduction

This repository tracks the source code and assets of the website of R package
[transltr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=transltr). Most files are
generated automatically using [pkgdown](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pkgdown)
from the main repository of the package whenever a new release is pushed to
CRAN. As such, this repository is not relevant and exists mostly for automation
purposes. See these links instead.

* See <https://transltr.ununoctium.dev> for the website's live version.
* See this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jeanmathieupotvin/transltr)
  for the source code of `transltr`.
* See `transltr` on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=transltr).

## Bugs and Feedback

You may submit bugs, request features, and provide feedback by creating an
[issue on GitHub](https://github.com/jeanmathieupotvin/transltr/issues/new)
(in the main repository).
